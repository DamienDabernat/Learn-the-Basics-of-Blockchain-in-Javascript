# Learn the basics of Blockchain is Javascript with less of 200 lines.

This is a simple implementation of a Blockchain in Javascript.
I use this project to teach the basics of Blockchain to my students. 

this course is realized during a module of IT culture at the school of Gobelins in Annecy.

## How to use it

Simply clone the project and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

Then run `npm start` to start the server.

Open your favorite browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/`.

Note : The web interface is not fully functional but all the basic features are implemented in code (including a very basic usage of NFT).

## Documentation

All the documentation is in the class `Blockchain.js` and `Block.js`. Everything is commented.
